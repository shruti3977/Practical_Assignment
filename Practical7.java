/*Aim :: Write a method public static int readInFile(String line, File file) that returns the
position number of a line in the file filename or âˆ’1 if there is no such line or file.
Assume that this file contains names of people with a name per line. Names (and
hence lines) are listed in ascending alphabetical order in the file. We can not find the
same line twice.
